# Introduction

Supercharge HTML for rapid, feature-rich website and web app development.

## What is Manifest?

Manifest is a frontend framework inspired and complimented by <a href="https://alpinejs.dev" target="_blank">Alpine JS</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>, bringing client-side functionality and style directly into HTML.

Manifest is comprised of Alpine plugins and CSS stylesheets, each offering modern features that can be used alone or together, and alongside other frameworks or libraries.

## Why Manifest?

HTML is the scaffolding of the digital world. It's more written than any human language, and read billions of times a day without being seen. But after 30+ years of evolution, it still lacks native support for much of what modern websites and apps demand—forcing developers to patch it with layers of frameworks that ultimately compile back into HTML.

**Manifest brings the developer experience home to HTML** (plus a few thoughtfully chosen content formats), making modern web development faster, lighter, and more enjoyable—without sacrificing flexibility or power. Its design philosophies include:

- Plug and play, no build steps.
- Style and function with less code.
- No performance sacrifice.
- Use only what you need.
- Develop with less noise and complexity.

## Core Features
- Alpine JS plugins for essential features like SPA routing, HTML components, color modes, localization, icons, and more.
- CSS stylesheets for normalization, pre-styled HTML elements, utility classes, and global theme management. Fully compatible with Tailwind v4+.
- Accessibility, i18n, SEO, and web app-ready.
- Centralized project configuration in `manifest.json`.
