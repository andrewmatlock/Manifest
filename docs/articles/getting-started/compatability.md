## Browsers

The latest version of Manifest is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.

Manifest only uses native language features that have been declared web-standard, but note that older browser versions—or divergent browser like Firefox—may lack support for more modern HTML and CSS capbilities, such as HTML's `popover` attribute for menus and tooltips. Polyfill scripts can be used to mimic support for these abilities in older browsers.
