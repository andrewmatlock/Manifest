## Installation

Install the starter project locally with the `npx` command:

## index.html

This main HTML file serves as the router's single-page application (SPA) entry point. It includes:

- **Head tags** for Manifest framework loading (from CDN), SEO, and web app configuration.
- **Component placeholders** (`<x-header>`, `<x-footer>`) of [HTML templates](/core-plugins/components).
- **Routing views** (`x-route="..."`) for [URL-specific content](/core-plugins/router).
- **Dynamic references** (`x-text="$x.content.page1"`) to localized [data source](/core-plugins/local-data) values.

## manifest.json

This <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Manifest" target="_blank">web application manifest</a> allows browsers to identify and export the website as an app to mobile and desktop devices. As a progressive web apps (PWA), your project is often more portable, scalable, and popular than traditional native apps, and can be packaged for app store distribution.

This project also uses the manifest to register its [components](/core-plugins/components) and [localized](/core-plugins/localiation) content, and to define `author` and `email` fields referenced by the Privacy Policy.
